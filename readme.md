# Node Garmin Health Oauth Example

Want to use the Garmin Health API with Node.js? Not familiar with Oauth1a? Look no further.

I've whipped this typescript example for your copying/cloning pleasure.

## Instructions for this example

Head over to the https://developer.garmin.com/health-api/overview/ and request access

Follow the instructions to get yourself an app which will get you a consumer key and secret.

Copy the sample.env to a file named .env and add the key and secret in addition to the Oauth URL's from the garmin documentation.
You can find the documentation in the garmin heath api developer portal.

You can now install the following and run the example.

```
npm i -g typescript ts-node
```


```
  npm i
```

```
  npm run dev
```

Happy dev'ing!
